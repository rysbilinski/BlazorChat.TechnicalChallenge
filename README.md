The intention of this challenge is to see your code style and structure and approach to a basic set of requirements. We are not expecting a pixel perfect UI but please feel free to get creative!

# Instructions

- build your solution and add any notes to the readme you like (can also add some screenshots)
- deploy your web app and add the URL
- when you're ready, add me to your repository as a colaborator and I will review
- we can then schedule a call to go through your solution and approach

# The Challenge

To build a basic conversation list and chat application using Blazor. The focus here is on the client application, so don't worry about real or meaningful API communication.

### Requirements

- built in blazor (any hosting model is fine)
- the should be a conversation list showing the list of chats
- there should be a chat screen showing the current selected chat
- the chat screen should differentiate between sender and receiver messages
- the chat should allow users to access local photos
- the application should be mobile responsive
  - for example, in desktop view you should be able to see the conversation list and chat pane side by side


### Desired but optional

- tailwinds CSS
- ability to switch theme of application


### NOTE:

the focus of this challenge is the client, so don't feel the need to spend time on a backend
